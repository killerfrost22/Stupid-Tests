    "### Personally speaking I would not prefer to take a lot of pictures during my time at the family gatherings. I think only a few nice shots would be good enough to me. Firstly, the family gathering is about getting together. Chatting and having fun is the most cherishable memory to me. Secondly, if I am the one who takes the pictures I may or maynot be in the picture. I have to make selections if I took a lot of pictures if there are just too much photos. I prefer simplicity in life, just like the Latin aphorism Carpe Diem which means seize the day in English. The most cherishable moment to me is not taking a lot of pictures."
