Some students who go to another country to study choose to live on their own or with a few friends
Others who prefer to stay with a family already live in the country which one do you choose?



I would prefer to live on my own or have a few friends around. Firstly if i live with a family, I will be part of their lives, 
if anything bad happens that I am involved with, I wouldnt have a good image in their family no matter how good is my realtionship with an individual
Secondly, I dont think anyone else can take better care of myself than myself. I can coo whatever I want and make music in my own studio without any interruptions.
